# Results in the Context of Open Science

## What are the advantages of making results open throughout the research process? 

1. Discuss advantages for each type of research object from ideation through to reporting. This should be particularly focused on ROs that are not part of data and software, but can link when needed. 
2. Describe how each of these advantages pertain to each ROs learned in Lesson 1
	* Avoids duplicating efforts 
	* Allows collaborators to receiving credit, and provides incentives for others to contribute
	* Facilitates collaboration and onboarding new members
	* Furthers the reach/audience of ROs (specific focus on publications, conference presentations) 
	* Saves time/enables efficiency (should tie back to stages of research: open workflow creates efficient pipelines from the start). Also should tie to Ethos where they mention “planning for open science” 

## What resources are available to address potential obstacles? What resources are available to help make results open? 

1. Briefly touch on potential obstacles pointed out by Ethos 
2. Focus on: 
	* Institutional open access agreements
	* Publishing open access & preprints
	* Funding/cost (e.g. waiver programs for fees and other cost offsetting programs)
3. Challenges with being open when reusing closed ROs by others (scenario highlighted by Shelley: a digital object created by someone else can not be deposited in a repository by somebody not associated with it. It needs to be cited from the best possible source. You can take steps to contact the object owner to make the deposit, but that rarely results in them complying. If the digital object is from the federal gov, they commonly have a process to request registering what you need with a DOI)
4. Placeholder for points not yet covered by Ethos, Data, Software

## Assessment: Case study analysis 

1. Building on self-assessment #2 in Lesson 1. Which of those elements were guided by FAIR principles? 
2. Flag the research objects you think could benefit from FAIR principles. 
3. Rank order those objects from “would benefit most from FAIR principles” to least
4. Rank order those objects from “would require most resources” to least 
5. Identify a few research objects that strike a balance between high priority and resources required
