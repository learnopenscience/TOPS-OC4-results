# TOPS Core Curriculum Module 4: Open Results

Welcome to the Open Results Module! In Open Ethos we learned about the ethics and principles underlying responsible, open science practices. In Open Software we explored and identified the right tools and methods that allows us to ensure reproducibility through version control, code testing, workflow, and virtual research environment. In Open Data we developed a data management plan that can ensure Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability (FAIR) of our data throughout the research, and not just at the end when the final report from the project is released. In this module, we will explore the different stages of the research process - including identifying the different types of research objects in a study and the various ways in which they can be shared and disseminated.

We will provide an overview of the research lifecycle and research outputs (Lesson 1). We will discuss the different stages of the research process, from planning all the way through (and beyond) dissemination. Along the way we will consider what the results of your work are, the “objects” in a research study, and how they can be shared (Lessons 2-3). By the end of the module we will have looked at the important concepts and practices for publishing and sharing of research components before, during and after the project. Special attention will be given to ensuring ethical contributorship (i.e., making sure collaboration is fair, inclusive, and that credit is assigned transparently and equitably).
