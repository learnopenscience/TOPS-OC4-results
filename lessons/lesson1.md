# Lesson 1: The Research Process and Its Results

## What are the different stages of the research process?

1. Define research stages: ideation, planning, project design, data collection, data processing, data analysis, reporting & publication, preservation and reuse, scientific engagement (Figure 1) 
	* Ensure consistency amongst lessons and modules, esure briefness to not lose scientific audience well-versed in the scientific process
2. What results are commonly associated with the research stages?
	* Provide examples of results associated with each research stage.
	* Describe how results that are digital can be made open and discoverable and are known as “digital research objects” 
	* Tools Module has 6 categories of ROs and we need to be consistent: data, protocols, materials, code, results, other
	* Showcase what research objects are possible outcomes of the research process (Table 1)

## Assessment: Identify the research objects in a case study 
## Self-assessment: Identify the research objects of a project you are/were involved in
