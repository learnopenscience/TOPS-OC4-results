# Lesson 3: Applying Open Result Framework to your Research 

## How to apply an open framework across different research object
1. Checklist for identifying the right platform for your ROs (link to Tools and expand on areas not covered in tools). For example: Does it assign a DOI? Does it enable licensing? Does it have metadata handling? 

## How to share your results, and select tools that support open science?

## Assesment: Case Study Analysis 
1. From Lesson 3, consider the three highest priority research objects that could benefit from openness:
	* Identify possible platforms where these research object could be hosted 
	* Identify any modifications to this research objects that would enable it to abide by principles of openness
